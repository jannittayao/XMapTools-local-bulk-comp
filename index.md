## Finding a local bulk composition with XMapTools

This tutorial uses the following files in addition to the element maps and traverse data: 

- `map.py`
	-   Python script to clean element map data. Specifically formatted for CAMECA microprobe output. 
- `Classification.txt`
	- fdsfa
- `Standards.txt`
	- fjsdklaf
-   `XMapToolsCoordinatesTool.xls`
	- fdjsaf
- `standards_cleaned.xls`
	- fdsafjkl
- 


The `Classification.txt	`,`Standards.txt`, `XMapToolsCoordinatesTool.xls`, and `standards_cleaned.xls` files can be found on the [XMapTools home page](https://www.xmaptools.com/additional-tools-files/) but are also in the [Github](https://github.com/jannittayao/XMapTools-local-bulk-comp) repository that this page is hosted on for your convenience.
