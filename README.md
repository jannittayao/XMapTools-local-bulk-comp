This tutorial serves as a walkthrough for using XMapTools to find the local (or effective) bulk composition of a thin-section from X-ray element maps. 

[XMapTools](https://www.xmaptools.com/) is run on [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) and its development is led by Dr. Pierre Lanari. For more information on how to set up and run XMapTools from the MATLAB command window, refer to Section 2 from the [XMapTools User Guide](https://www.xmaptools.com/XMapTools.3.4_UserGuide.pdf).
